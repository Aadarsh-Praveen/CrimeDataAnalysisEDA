CrimeDataAnalysisEDA

Objective:


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the dataset on criminal events in Los Angeles entails a systematic method to eliciting useful insights. Understanding the structure of the dataset and cleaning it are critical first steps in correcting missing or erroneous data entries. Basic summary statistics, temporal analysis, and geographical exploration demonstrate crime patterns over time and space. Analysis of crime categories and demographics might provide useful context. Data visualization assists in the presentation of data in an intelligible manner, while outlier identification and correlation analysis expand our comprehension. Finally, EDA provides a foundation for making educated decisions and developing successful crime prevention tactics.
